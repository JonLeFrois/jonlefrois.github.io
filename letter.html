                    Our art program offers a diverse range of courses, focusing on both traditional
                    and modern artistic techniques. Your enthusiasm for contemporary art techniques is
                    particularly exciting. Here are the courses that might interest you:
                </p>

                <h3>Artistic Inspirations</h3>
                <p>
                    It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern
                    art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Impressionism<br>
                    Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction
                    of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abstract Expressionalism<br>
                    This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had
                    a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pop Art<br>
                    A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular
                    culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
                </p>
