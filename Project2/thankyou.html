        <p>I appreciate you taking the time to embark on this journey. I hope you had a great experience, and thank you for playing!</p>
        <p>As I wrap up this journey, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude. Thank you to my computer science professors for their support in my academic career. This project, and everything I have done thus far has been better because of them.</p>
