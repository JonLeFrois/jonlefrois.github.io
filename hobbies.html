            <h3>Volleyball</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently in my 8th year playing volleyball. This includes JV/Varsity in highschool
                and 3 years on competitive travel team in highschool as well. I am also
                in my 4th year on the club team at Siena, and was an officer for two years. Some of my best
                accomplishments in the sport include back to back sectional titles in highschool and taking
                second in our division at college nationals my freshman year.
            </p>
            <h3>Roundnet</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently in my 4th year playing roundnet, better known as Spikeball, competitively. 
                This has included being a part of the club team at Siena which was started
                my freshman year. My tournament experience has included college tournaments, local
                tournaments, and more professional style tournaments as a part of the Spikeball Tour Series
                of tournaments as well as USA Roundnet and American Spikers League tournaments.
